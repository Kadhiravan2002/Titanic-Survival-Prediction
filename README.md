# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn (RandomForest)

## 📊 Workflow

1. Data cleaning and feature engineering
2. Model training (RandomForest)
3. Model evaluation (accuracy: ~82%)
4. Confusion matrix and classification report

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
    cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_eda_model.ipynb
    ```

## 📈 Model Accuracy

- **Accuracy**: ~82%
